**Description**

"Around The U.S." is an interactive page where users can add, remove, or like photos. Created with Responsive design in mind, working on both mobile devices and desktop, using CSS's Flexbox and Media Queries, HTML Forms, BEM Methodology and JavaScript DOM.

**Images**

The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 

Have fun with JavaScript!
